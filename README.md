Aionic offers open source applications for project management and collaboration. Our focus is on simplifying and accelerating the workflow of agile teams.

## About Aionic

We provide a set of **open source products** for project management, collarboration, productivity and more. All our products are released under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license, so feel free to customize them according to your teamâ€™s wishes.

Please keep in mind that we just develop the software and don't host the applications anywhere for public usage. That means you have to take care of the hosting for yourself. You can use a Linux cloud server with nginx for example.

All our products are built on top of [aionic-core](https://github.com/aionic-org/aionic-core/), since this is the place where all your data is maintained and distributed. So for the usage of any other application, you have to use at least aionic-core.

Moreover we highly advice to use [aionic-backend](https://github.com/aionic-org/aionic-backend/) for managing and configuring the data of your Aionic applications.

Installation and usage guides and be found at the GitHub repositories of the individual products.

Some of the technologies we use to build our software:

- Node.js
- React
- MySQL
- Redis
